# Advanced applications of Rolling Hash

## Problems

1. [ ] Finding the lexicographically minimal cyclic shift of a string of length n in O(n log n) time
2. [ ] Sorting of all cyclic shifts of a string of length n in lexicographic order in O(n log^2 n) time
3. [ ] Finding the number of sub-palindromes of a string of length n in O(n log n) time
4. [ ] Largest common prefix of two strings length n with swapping two chars in one of them in O(n log n) time
5. [ ] The number of suffixes of a string of length n, the infinite extension of which coincides with the infinite extension of the given string for O(n log n) (extension is a duplicate string an infinite number of times)
